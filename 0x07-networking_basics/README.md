### **Task 0:** [0-OSI_model](0-OSI_model)
#####  What is the OSI model?
- [ ] 2.The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology

#### How is the OSI model organized?
- [ ] 2.From the lowest to the highest level


### **Task 1:** [1-types_of_network](1-types_of_network)
#### What type of network a computer in local is connected to?
- [ ] 3.LAN

#### What type of network could connect an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away?
- [ ] 2.WAN

#### What network do you use when you browse www.google.com from your smartphone (not connected to the Wifi)?
- [ ] 1.Internet


### **Task 2:** [2-MAC_and_IP_address](2-MAC_and_IP_address)
#### What is a MAC address?
- [ ] 2.The unique identifier of a network interface

#### What is an IP address?
- [ ] 1.Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses


### **Task 3:** [3-UDP_and_TCP](3-UDP_and_TCP)
#### Which statement is correct for the TCP box:
- [ ] 1.It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely

#### Which statement is correct for the UDP box:
- [ ] 2.It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process

#### Which statement is correct for the TCP worker:
- [ ] 1.Have you received boxes x, y, z?


### **Task 4:** [4-TCP_and_UDP_ports](4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)
```
 - Bash script that displays listening ports.
	Requirements:
		- That only shows listening sockets
		- That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs
```


### **Task 5:** [5-is_the_host_on_the_network](5-is_the_host_on_the_network)
```
 - Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.
	Requirements:
		- Accepts a string as an argument
		- Displays Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS} if no argument passed
		- Ping the IP 5 times
